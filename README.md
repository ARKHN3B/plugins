# Netlify Plugins

[Build Plugins](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins) are a new way to extend the functionality of your build on Netlify. The [`plugins.json` file](./plugins.json) in this repository is used to generate the [Netlify plugins directory](https://app.netlify.com/plugins). Plugins in this directory can be installed directly through the Netlify UI.

## Contributing

3. Continue being super cool, awesome, & fun. ðŸ˜Ž
